"""nono: Capability-based sandboxing for Python.

This module provides OS-enforced sandboxing using Landlock (Linux) and
Seatbelt (macOS). Once a sandbox is applied, unauthorized operations are
structurally impossible.

Example:
    >>> from nono_py import CapabilitySet, AccessMode, apply
    >>> caps = CapabilitySet()
    >>> caps.allow_path("/tmp", AccessMode.READ_WRITE)
    >>> caps.block_network()
    >>> apply(caps)  # Irreversible!

Classes:
    AccessMode: File system access mode (READ, WRITE, READ_WRITE)
    CapabilitySet: Collection of sandbox permissions
    CapabilitySource: Origin of a capability grant
    FsCapability: A filesystem capability grant
    SandboxState: Serializable snapshot of capabilities
    SupportInfo: Platform support information
    QueryContext: Query permissions without applying sandbox

Functions:
    apply(caps): Apply the sandbox (irreversible)
    is_supported(): Check if sandboxing is available
    support_info(): Get platform support details
